        Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tejas Khile, and I'm a committed Full-Stack Web Developer who loves building dynamic, user-centered websites. I enjoy turning creative concepts into smooth, useful digital solutions, and I am skilled in both frontend and backend development.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Hereâ€™s what I specialize in:
        <br/>
        ~Creating user-friendly interfaces with contemporary frameworks such as React.<br/>
        ~Creating scalable and reliable backend structures with ExpressJS, Node.js, and other tools.<br/>
        ~Putting responsive designs into practice and guaranteeing top performance on all platforms.<br/>
        <br/>
        What distinguishes me? I try to produce clear, effective, and maintainable code by fusing my strong technical abilities with a problem-solving mindset. Additionally, I have a strong commitment to learning about and remaining current with the newest trends and best practices in web development.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can probably find me unwinding with a nice book, experimenting with new technologies, taking on coding challenges, or an interesting anime series when I'm not coding. After all, who doesn't enjoy a good story?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Together, let's make something truly remarkable. <br/>
        Say "Hey!" and reach out. I'm excited to hear from you!
